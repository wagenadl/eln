  /* Use hushhush to prevent escalation of the modification. This is useful
     because setCellLength will make the data inconsistent until the text
     is updated with setText. So the drill is: *first* call setCellLength,
     with hushhush true, then, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, call setText to make
     things be consistent again.
     I should probably reconsider this mechanism, and instead implement
     a setCellContents method. Then I could make setText private, because
     setText is dangerous on a table: there is no verification of internal
     consistency.
     On the other hand, TextData has a similar issue with setText and markups,
     and it doesn't enforce anything.
